Title: Top 10 Quiz Questions That Always Stump Teams

Content:
--------

After hosting hundreds of quiz nights across North East England, I've noticed certain questions that consistently leave teams scratching their heads. Here are ten of the most challenging (and entertaining) stumpers:

1. Geography: Which Country Has The Most Time Zones?

Most teams guess Russia or the USA, but the answer is France! Thanks to its overseas territories, France spans 12 time zones.

2. Science: What Is The Only Letter That Doesn't Appear In Any US State Name?

The letter Q! This one catches even the most confident teams.

3. Music: What Was The First Music Video Played On MTV?

"Video Killed The Radio Star" by The Buggles, aired on August 1, 1981.

4. History: How Long Did The Hundred Years' War Last?

116 years (1337-1453)! The name is misleading.

5. Literature: What Is The Opening Line of George Orwell's 1984?

"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen."

6. Film: Which Actor Has Been Nominated For The Most Oscars Without Winning?

Glenn Close, with 8 nominations and no wins (as of 2024).

7. Sports: What Is The Only Sport To Have Been Played On The Moon?

Golf! Alan Shepard hit a golf ball on the moon in 1971.

8. Food & Drink: What Is The Main Ingredient In A Traditional Béarnaise Sauce?

Clarified butter - many teams guess egg or cream.

9. General Knowledge: What Is A Group Of Flamingos Called?

A flamboyance! One of the best collective nouns.

10. Nature: How Many Hearts Does An Octopus Have?

Three! One main heart and two smaller ones for the gills.

Why These Questions Work

The best quiz questions are ones where:
- The answer seems obvious but isn't
- There's a twist in the wording
- Common knowledge gets challenged
- Teams can debate and discuss

These questions always generate great atmosphere in the room, with teams conferring, debating, and sometimes taking educated guesses.
